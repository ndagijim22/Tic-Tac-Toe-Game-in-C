# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-C

Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players pick X's or 0's alternatively in a matrix cell
formed by two vertical and horizontal lines crossing each other. Each player tries to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The player who put in this form will succeed in the game. This project will implement a tic tac toe game in C language.

# Problem Description

Write a C program to play the Tic Tac Toe game.

# Problem Solution

We have to use 2D array to store the player sign. The 2D array will be initially empty that means every cell contains space character. On every move of the player, the cell will be filled by its input position.

We will build this program using C programming language in which we use a 2D array to store the cell position and update on every move.
